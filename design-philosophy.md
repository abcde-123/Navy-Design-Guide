## Design Philosophy

### Human-Centered Design

Understand our users and end users better than they understand themselves.

Human-centered design, also known as HCD, is a creative approach to problem solving that places people at the center of design considerations rather than making people conform to a design. 
Human-centered design is rooted in both primary and secondary research. 
..* Primary research is any type of research you conduct yourself. Primary research is the gathering, compiling, organization and analysis of interviews, focus groups, surveys, questionnaires and observations. 
..* Secondary research is the collection and analysis of research that has already been compiled, gathered, organized and published by others. It includes reports and studies by governments, think-tanks, universities, agencies, associations, businesses or other researchers.

### Content is King

Place an emphasis on quality of content. This can be done by creating a value on quality content, stripping away the unnecessary, focusing on the key experience, and minimising distractions. Far too often the quantity available is far more than the average user can consume. In these situations, consider whether such an overwhelming array of choices is actually useful.

### Accessible Design is Good Design

Design should be usable on all devices by all of the people in all situations. Design is simple, touch friendly, clear and aims for AA accessibility.
