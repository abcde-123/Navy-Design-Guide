# Welcome!
We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to this U.S. Navy open source project! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

# Guidance on how to contribute
There are two primary ways to help: 
 - Using the issue tracker, and 
 - Changing the code-base.

## Using the issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions. 
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well
as others who are interested in this solution.  

Use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Find a bug or a feature, mention in
the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the _Changing the code-base_ 
guidance below.

## Changing the code-base

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your
own fork, and then submit a pull-request. All new code should have associated unit
tests that validate implemented features and the presence or lack of defects. 
Additionally, the code should follow any stylistic and architectural guidelines 
prescribed by the project. In the absence of such guidelines, mimic the styles
and patterns in the existing code-base.
