## User Interface (UI)

### Buttons

Buttons are clear, and considers readability for comprehension, as well as ease-of-use.  Use the selected brand colors and accessibility parameters when creating the desired color scheme or user interface patterns.

For example:

<button class="button-example">Button Example 1</button>
	    
<button class="button-example-2">Button Example 2</button>

<button class="button-example-3"><strong>Button Example 3</strong></button>

<hr>

### Links

All hover states are underlined to provide clear indication that it links to specific content.  As well, all links must be descript.  Instead of "Click Here" it needs to provide linguistic clarity for users, such as "Learn more about our Navy". 

For example:  

[Learn more about our Navy](https://usnavy.github.io/Navy-Design-Guide/ui-elements.html)

In addition, it is useful and beneficial to provide supporting context or subtext when applicable or necessary. 

For example:

<a href="#" class="link-example">
	<strong>Subscriptions</strong><br>
	Subscribe to all things Navy
	</a>

For example:

<div class="input-example">			
<span>First Name</span>	
<input type="text" name="keyword" placeholder="-First Name-" class="input-box">
</div>
