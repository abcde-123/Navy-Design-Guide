## Motion

### Choreography 

#### Transitions

Transitions are coordinated sequences of motion that maintains user focus as the interface adapts.

<div class="container-hide">

For Example:

<a class="hvr-underline-from-left">Motion Example 1</a>

<button class="hvr-rectangle-in"><strong>Motion Example 2</strong></button>

<button class="hvr-shrink"><strong>Motion Example 3</strong></button>

<button class="hvr-bubble-right"><strong>Motion Example 4</strong></button>

</div>

#### Sequences

Sequences refers to the order in which different parts of things appear, start moving, and stop moving.

A good sequence makes it easy to understand what has changed about a screen, if any elements were added or removed, and whatâ€™s important to know about the next interaction.
