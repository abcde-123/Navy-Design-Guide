## Motion

### Choreography 

#### Transitions

Transitions are coordinated sequences of motion that maintains user focus as the interface adapts.

#### Sequences

Sequences refers to the order in which different parts of things appear, start moving, and stop moving.

A good sequence makes it easy to understand what has changed about a screen, if any elements were added or removed, and whatâ€™s important to know about the next interaction.

For Example: <br>
<a class="hvr-underline-from-left"><strong>Motion Example 1</strong></a>

<button class="hvr-rectangle-in">Motion Example 2</button>
