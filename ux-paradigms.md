## User Experience Paradigms (UX)

### Clean and Clear

Clarity helps establish clear performance of a task or consumption of information. We focus on the essentials and guide the user through particular highlights by means of a clear-cut hierarchy. We provide clear information to user needs and show where a piece of information is or how up-to-date it is.

### Organized

Users can choose individually from a range of different interests, positions and objectives. To create a positive experience, it is important to understand and to incorporate the needs of the user in the design. It is important to provide users benefits.

### Reliable

Transparency and data protection are very important to the user. Since more and more services are interconnected across different systems and devices, the user has to be able to rely on every element in the ecosystem.

By clearly communicating, we are able to give the user the opportunity to view all the relevant information while still keeping necessary information out of the public.

### Consistent

We use a clear visual language to users on all channels and offer recurring solutions. Entire sets of content, hierarchies and functions are structured identically across all devices. In this way, we make it easier for users to perform complex tasks and we create a uniform overall experience.

### Detailed

Details are not an option: they are a fundamental component of our visual appearance. We apply details such as iconography and imagery selectively to create a quality user experience.
