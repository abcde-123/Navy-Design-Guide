## Imagery

### Light

Natural light sources ensure images have an authentic, unembellished look. The composition and narrative is integrated in the lighting situation and is not artificially highlighted.  Light and shade creates accents in the atmospheric perspective while it can still be used as stylistic devices to tell stories or support ideas.

#### Color Space and Contrast

Color saturation is not excessive or too bright.  We make use of contrast that is clear. Color and contrast can also be used as stylistic devices.

### Perspective and Details

Particular image details, sections, and unusual perspectives can give images a distinct character that sets it apart.  Natural perspectives give the motifs a modern look.

#### Deep Focus

Deep focus provides imagery with great depth, and for enhanced visual clarity.  Deep focus provides detail balance in partner with deep spaces and nuances, while still being used as stylistic devices to tell stories or support ideas.

#### Definition and Blur

The interplay of definition and blur is put to selective use to create a focus and a natural look.  In this way, the attention is drawn to a specific idea or thought.  Supporting elements can be out of focus if it supports the motif.

### People

People are shown in authentic, uncontrived situations, and the way they are presented is always easy to comprehend.
